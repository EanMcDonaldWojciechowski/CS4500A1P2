This program has three .h files- array.h, string.h, and object.h. string.h and object.h have the same method signatures and fields as in the previous assignment.
Array is very similar to the StringList class created in the previous assignment, except every instance of String in the fields and signatures is replaced by Object. 
We also removed the uneccessary methods from StringList, such as push_back and index_Of. The array can be constructed of any class that implements the Object class.
